# line-follower-obstacle-avoider-car
Our latest Arduino Project code 
## Description 
The car has 3 wheels, 3 sensors (2 IR sensors and 1 Ultrasonic), Arduino nano, Hbridge, breadboard, 2 motors, and the battery.

## Moving mechanism
The car has two sensors one left and one right, the car moves forward automatically, when one of the sensors detect the black line, it gives a signal to the microcontroller (Arduino); to rotate left or right. And when the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle, it gives a signal to the microcontroller (Arduino); to avoid it by turning around the obstacle. the wheels are 2 connected to the motor
for leading the car, 1 back wheel for supporting the veichle.

## The Arduino type: 
Arduino nano microcontroller.
